# SURFS_UP.

## OBJECTIVE
Helping W.Avy get on board along with the board of directors to start a new business (SURF AND SHAKE SHOP) on one of the Hawaiian Islands

## PROCESS
We analysed the island of OAHU's weather to determine the potential of the business growth

## LEARNING
We looked at the June and December weather. There is not much of a difference in the weather between the two months, the variation isin the mean of the temperature is less that 4F.

June MIN    =   64F         MAX =   80F
December MIN=   56F         MAX =   83F

There is only a 8F difference in the coldest days between June and December, and only 3F differnece in the hottest days.
However the is a record of more rain in the months of December than in JUNE

## FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS
We have only analysed two of twelve months for this businsess proposal. We need to look at the whole yearly climate and study previous years and any anomolies.
