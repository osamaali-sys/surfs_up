# SURFS_UP.

## OBJECTIVE
Helping W.Avy get on board along with the board of directors to start a new business (SURF AND SHAKE SHOP) on one of the Hawaiian Islands

## PROCESS
We analysed the island of OAHU's weather to determine the potential of the business growth

## LEARNING
We looked at the June and December weather. There is not much of a difference in the weather between the two months, the variation isin the mean of the temperature is less that 4F.

June MIN    =   64F         MAX =   80F

December MIN=   56F         MAX =   83F

There is only a 8F difference in the coldest days between June and December, and only 3F differnece in the hottest days.

## FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS
We have only analysed two of twelve months for this businsess proposal. We need to look at the whole yearly climate and study previous years and any anomolies. We could also look into yearly percepitation data to ensure business wont be affected during launch time.

There is a record of more rain in the months of December than in JUNE. We need to look at all the months and previous yearly data for the best decision making.
